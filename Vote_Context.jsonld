    "comment": "DRep VCC vote ‚ùå NO on this proposal for the following reasons:\n\nüëâ There is no clear evidence that reducing the contribution to the Treasury will increase the number of staking participants. This requires concrete data and analysis rather than assumptions.\n\nüëâ The Cardano ecosystem needs more resources from the Treasury, not only to fund development projects but also to boost marketing, attract new users, and support liquidity for DApps. Reducing the Treasury‚Äôs funds could slow down these efforts.\n\nüëâ A slight increase in staking rewards does not bring significant benefits to delegators, whereas strong investment in ecosystem development creates real value, helping ADA appreciate sustainably. The focus should be on long-term growth rather than short-term benefits."
